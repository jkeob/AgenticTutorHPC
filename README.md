# Agentic HPC Tutor

_A lightweight, offline-friendly, multi-agent tutor for HPC lesson planning, concept explanation, code scaffolding, execution, and review._

This repo implements the system described in the accompanying paper, centered on a **Session agent** that coordinates specialist agents (Explainer, Quizzer, Coder, Reviewer) and an **Executor** that compiles/runs code and returns observations for self-correction. It’s designed to work on laptops or institutional clusters without proprietary APIs.

> **Project status:** early but usable. The code you see here is the minimal core. Additional folders (examples, jobs, scripts, tests, docs) are stubbed below for future population.
